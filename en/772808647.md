If you've been feeling tired all the time for weeks and keep losing weight without trying—especially if you’ve noticed stomach pain or your skin looking a bit yellow—it’s completely natural to feel worried. These symptoms signal something is going on in your body, and it's important to get to the bottom of it. You're not alone in your concern, and you’re doing the right thing by seeking more information. This post will walk you through potential causes and, most importantly, guide you on who to see next and what the initial costs might be for evaluations in Chicago, IL. You’re in the right place to take informed and reassuring steps toward your health.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Chicago, IL

With symptoms like constant tiredness, unexplained weight loss, stomach pain, and yellowing skin, a few types of doctors could be good places to start. Each can help diagnose the possible causes and recommend treatments or further testing if needed:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and manage a wide variety of symptoms. They are often the best first contact as they can order blood tests and help determine if you need to see a specialist.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specialists in adult medicine who handle complex or chronic conditions. They can provide thorough exams and coordinate needed tests.
- **Gastroenterologist:** A doctor specialized in digestive system issues, useful if your stomach pain and yellowing skin suggest liver or gastrointestinal problems.
- **Hematology-Oncology Specialist:** In cases where symptoms suggest a possible blood disorder or cancer, this specialist assesses and manages those conditions.

Starting with a Family Practice or Internal Medicine doctor is common because they can help identify the issue or guide you to the right specialist.
