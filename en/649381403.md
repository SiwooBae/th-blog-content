## Who to See for Your Symptoms in New York, NY

Based on your symptoms—tiredness, weight gain, and shortness of breath—there are several types of healthcare providers who could be good starting points. Here are the most relevant professionals and what they do:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of common health problems. They can order initial tests to help find the cause of your symptoms and guide you if a specialist is needed.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Similar to family practice but often focused on adults; they manage complex or chronic conditions and coordinate care.
- **Endocrinologist:** A specialist in hormone-related conditions, such as thyroid disorders and diabetes, both of which can cause tiredness and weight gain.
- **Cardiologist:** If your shortness of breath might be related to your heart, a cardiologist evaluates and treats heart and circulation issues.

Starting with a family practice or internal medicine doctor is often a good first step since they can provide a broad initial assessment and refer you if specialized care is needed.
