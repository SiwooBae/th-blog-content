## Who to See for Your Symptoms in New York

Based on your symptoms — a persistent cough, chest tightness, tiredness, and mucus — a few types of doctors might be the best starting points:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of common illnesses, including prolonged coughs. They can also order tests and refer you to specialists if needed.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Focuses on adult health and complex conditions. They can evaluate your symptoms thoroughly and manage more complicated respiratory issues.
- **Pulmonary Disease Specialist:** A doctor trained specifically in lung and breathing problems. If your cough relates to asthma, chronic bronchitis, or other lung conditions, they are ideal.
- **Allergy/Immunology Specialist:** If your cough might be caused by allergies or immune system issues, these doctors can test and treat those problems.

Each of these providers can help evaluate your cough and decide what treatment or tests might be necessary.
