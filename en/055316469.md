This post will guide you through potential next steps, including who you might want to see for an evaluation, what to expect during your first visits, and an overview of estimated costs you might face if you’re paying out of pocket.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Houston

Your symptoms of constant thirst, frequent urination, unusual tiredness, and dizziness may point to an underlying condition that requires professional evaluation. Based on these signs, here are some types of healthcare providers you might consider:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of health issues. They are a great first step for evaluating your symptoms and can order the necessary tests or refer you to a specialist if needed.

- **Endocrinologist:** A doctor specializing in hormone-related conditions, including diabetes and thyroid disorders. If your symptoms suggest something related to blood sugar or hormone imbalance, this might be the specialist you’ll see.

- **Internal Medicine Physician:** Similar to family practice but focused mainly on adult health, internal medicine doctors manage complex or chronic conditions and can also help diagnose the cause of your symptoms.

All these providers are well-equipped to help you identify the reason behind your symptoms and start appropriate treatment.
