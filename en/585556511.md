## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Long Beach

Based on your symptoms of chest tightness, arm tingling, and shortness of breath, a few types of healthcare providers can be good first points of contact:

- **Emergency Medicine**: If your chest pain feels severe, sudden, or is accompanied by alarming symptoms like heavy shortness of breath or severe arm pain, visiting an emergency medicine provider at an emergency room is critical. They are equipped to quickly diagnose and manage urgent heart or lung conditions.
- **Family Practice**: A family practice doctor is a generalist who can evaluate a wide range of health concerns, including chest pain. They can determine if your symptoms warrant referral to a specialist or emergency care.
