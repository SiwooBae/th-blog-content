## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Atlanta, GA

Based on your symptoms—chest pain, shortness of breath, and arm numbness—you have several types of healthcare providers who could be good first stops:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who diagnoses and treats a wide range of conditions. They can evaluate your symptoms, provide initial testing, and refer you to specialists if needed.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specializes in adult care and chronic conditions, and can provide a thorough assessment of your cardiovascular risks.
