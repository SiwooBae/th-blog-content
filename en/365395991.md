Many people experience these symptoms, and you’re not alone in wanting to understand what’s going on before it starts interfering with your day-to-day life.

This post is here to help you take clear, practical next steps.

You're doing the right thing by researching—let’s make the next steps easier for you.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Long Beach, CA

Based on your description of joint stiffness, achiness, and swelling in your fingers and knees, there are a few types of healthcare providers who could be a good starting point:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who diagnoses and treats many common health conditions. They can evaluate your joint pain, order initial tests, and refer you to a specialist if needed.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** A specialist in adult medicine who deals with a wide range of illnesses, including chronic conditions and joint problems. They can provide thorough assessments and management.
- **Rheumatologist:** A doctor specialized in diseases of the joints, muscles, and bones, such as arthritis. If your symptoms suggest something like rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory condition, this specialist is equipped for advanced diagnosis and treatment.

Each of these providers has a slightly different role, and depending on the severity and persistence of your symptoms, starting with a Family Practice or Internal Medicine doctor is often recommended. If needed, they can then direct you to a Rheumatologist.
