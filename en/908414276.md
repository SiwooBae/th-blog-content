# Swollen Ankles and Tired All the Time? Next Steps for Los Angeles, CA

Feeling constantly tired and noticing your ankles are swollen can be concerning, especially when accompanied by other symptoms like foamy urine and needing to pee more at night. It’s completely natural to feel worried and to seek information without knowing the exact medical terms. You’re not alone—many people search for answers based on symptoms just like yours. 

This post will help you understand possible causes, guide you on which healthcare providers to consider seeing first, and provide an idea of what initial tests and visits might cost in the Los Angeles area. Let’s take a calm and clear step forward together, so you know exactly what to do next.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Los Angeles

Based on your symptoms, there are a few types of doctors who could help:

- **Family Practice Doctor**  
  A Family Practice doctor is a generalist who can evaluate your overall health, identify potential causes of symptoms like swelling and fatigue, and order basic tests to start diagnosing the problem.

- **Internal Medicine Doctor**  
  Internal Medicine specialists focus on adult health and managing complex or chronic conditions. They can dig deeper if your symptoms suggest issues like kidney or thyroid problems.
