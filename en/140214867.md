If you've been feeling consistently tired, noticing swollen ankles, a puffy face, and frequent nighttime urination, along with an itchy skin sensation that just won’t go away, it’s completely understandable why you’re concerned. These symptoms can feel overwhelming and confusing, especially when they seem to be getting worse over time. You’re taking a smart first step by seeking information and understanding what to do next to protect your health.

This guide is here to help you understand which healthcare providers might be the best to consult based on your symptoms, what kinds of procedures or tests to expect, and an overview of estimated self-pay costs for these services in Atlanta, GA. The goal is to empower you with clear knowledge so you can confidently take the next step and get the care you need.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Atlanta, GA

Given your symptoms — tiredness, swelling in the ankles and face, frequent urination at night, and itchy skin — there are a few types of doctors who would be a good place to start:

- **Nephrology**: Specialists focused on kidney health. Since swelling and changes in urination can be signs of kidney issues, a nephrologist can evaluate your kidney function and related concerns.
- **Endocrinology**: Doctors who treat hormonal and metabolic conditions. Swelling and tiredness might relate to thyroid or other hormonal imbalances, making an endocrinologist an important option.
- **Internal Medicine**: Internists are experts in adult medicine and often handle complex symptoms that may involve multiple body systems, making them a valuable resource for diagnosis and treatment.
- **Family Practice**: Family doctors are generalists who manage a wide range of health issues and can coordinate your care or refer you to specialists as needed.
- **Dermatology**: Since you have an itchy skin feeling, a dermatologist can help diagnose and treat skin-related causes of your symptoms.

Each of these providers has different areas of expertise that might be relevant to your situation, and starting with one who fits your most pressing symptoms can help get you on the right track.
