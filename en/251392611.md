## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Chicago

When you have sudden difficulty breathing, a few types of healthcare providers are often good first steps for evaluation and treatment:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist doctor who treats a wide range of health issues. They can evaluate your breathing, prescribe treatments, and decide if you need specialized care.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specialized in adult health, they focus on diagnosing and managing chronic and acute illnesses, including respiratory problems.
- **Allergy/Immunology Specialist:** These doctors diagnose and treat allergies, asthma, and immune system conditions, which can cause breathing difficulties.
- **Pulmonary Disease Specialist:** A lung specialist who can provide in-depth testing and treatment for breathing and lung problems.
- **Emergency Medicine Provider:** Available in emergency rooms for urgent, high-acuity conditions requiring immediate intervention.

Each of these providers may be involved depending on how severe or sudden your symptoms are. Starting with a family practice or internal medicine doctor is often a good choice if the situation doesn’t feel life-threatening. If your breathing difficulty worsens quickly or you feel extreme distress, seek emergency care immediately.
