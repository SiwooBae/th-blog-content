## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Dallas, TX

Based on your symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing, there are several types of doctors who could be good places to start your evaluation and care:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can assess a wide range of health concerns, including respiratory issues, and refer you to a specialist if needed. Great if you want one provider to manage your overall care.
- **Internal Medicine Specialist:** Focuses on adult health and can diagnose and treat lung and other internal health problems.
- **Pulmonary Disease Specialist:** A lung expert who specializes in breathing problems, asthma, and other respiratory conditions. Ideal if your primary care doctor suspects a lung disease.
- **Allergy/Immunology Specialist:** If your doctor thinks allergies or immune-related issues could be triggering your cough and breathing problems, these providers can evaluate and treat underlying causes.

Each provider type plays a role in diagnosing and managing your symptoms, so starting with a Family Practice or Internal Medicine doctor is often a practical first step. They can then refer you to a specialist if necessary.
