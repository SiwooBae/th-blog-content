## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Dallas, TX

Based on your symptoms—yellow skin (which may indicate jaundice), a swollen belly, and persistent tiredness—several types of healthcare providers could be good starting points:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A family practice doctor is a generalist who can evaluate a wide range of symptoms, order initial tests, and guide you toward specialists if needed. They are often the first step in identifying what might be going on.

- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specialists in adult medicine, internal medicine doctors can handle complex or ongoing health issues. They can help evaluate symptoms like yours and perform detailed testing.

- **Gastroenterologist:** This type of doctor specializes in the digestive system and liver health. Given the yellow skin and swollen belly symptoms, a gastroenterologist is often involved in diagnosing liver or abdominal conditions.
