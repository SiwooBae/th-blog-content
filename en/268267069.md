# Why Are My Ankles Swollen? Understanding Symptoms and Care Options in The Woodlands, TX

If you've noticed your ankles are swollen and you're feeling very tired lately, you're understandably concerned—especially with new symptoms like waking up at night to use the bathroom more often or seeing foamy urine. These signs can feel worrying, and it's natural to want answers about what's causing them. You’re not alone, and it’s good you're paying attention to your body.

This post is here to help guide you through what might be happening, suggest the types of healthcare providers who can evaluate your symptoms, and give you an overview of what initial visits and tests might cost in The Woodlands, TX. Our goal is to help you feel more prepared to take the next step toward care.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in The Woodlands, TX

Based on your symptoms—swollen ankles, fatigue, increased urination at night, and foamy urine—you have several good options for where to start:

- **Family Practice Doctor**  
  A Family Practice doctor is a generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of health issues. They are usually the best first stop to evaluate your symptoms, order initial tests, and guide you to specialists if needed.

- **Internal Medicine Physician**  
  Internal Medicine doctors focus on adult health conditions and complex diagnostic cases. They can provide detailed evaluations and manage chronic illnesses, including those that may relate to swelling and kidney or heart issues.

- **Nephrologist (Kidney Specialist)**  
  Since some of your symptoms concern urination and foamy urine—which can indicate kidney function problems—a Nephrologist specializes in kidney health and could be the right expert to consult if initial tests suggest kidney involvement.

- **Cardiologist (Heart Specialist)**  
  Swollen ankles can sometimes be related to heart issues. A Cardiologist assesses heart health and can evaluate whether your symptoms relate to circulation or heart function.
