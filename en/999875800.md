Don't hesitate to get evaluated for your breathlessness by a Cardiologist, or mental health support from a Psychiatrist if you feel it might help.
- **Prepare for Your Visit:** Write down your symptoms, when they started, what makes them better or worse, and any questions or concerns you have to share during your visit.
- **Discuss Costs:** Call the provider’s office before your appointment to confirm what the self-pay or insurance costs might be, as the estimates here can vary.
