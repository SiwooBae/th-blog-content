## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Anaheim, CA

Based on your symptoms—tiredness, joint pain, and a distinctive facial rash—several types of doctors could be a good place to start:

- **Dermatologist:** A dermatologist specializes in skin conditions. They can evaluate your facial rash to identify if it is part of a skin disorder or related to an underlying health condition.
- **Rheumatologist:** This type of doctor focuses on autoimmune diseases and joint issues. Since you have joint pain along with fatigue and a facial rash, a rheumatologist can assess for autoimmune disorders such as lupus, which sometimes cause these combined symptoms.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** An internal medicine provider treats a wide range of adult illnesses and can coordinate initial testing and referrals, especially for systemic symptoms like fatigue and rash.
- **Family Practice Doctor:** A family practice physician is a generalist who can evaluate your symptoms, order necessary blood tests, and refer you to a specialist if needed. They provide comprehensive care and often serve as your first step in the healthcare system.
