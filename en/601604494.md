## Who to See for Your Symptoms in New York, NY

Based on your symptoms of persistent tiredness, swollen glands, and rash, there are a few types of medical specialists and doctors who could be a good place to start your care journey:

- **Family Practice Doctor**: A family practice doctor is a generalist who diagnoses and treats a wide variety of health issues. They are often the best first step for ongoing symptoms and can refer you to specialists if needed.

- **Internal Medicine Doctor**: Internal medicine doctors focus on adult health and complex medical conditions. They can investigate symptoms like fever, fatigue, and swollen glands, and arrange relevant tests.

- **Dermatologist**: If you have a rash that won’t go away, a dermatologist specializes in skin conditions and can provide diagnosis and treatment for rashes.

- **Hematologist**: If swollen glands and fatigue might relate to blood or immune system issues, a hematologist can evaluate and run specialized blood tests.

- **Infectious Disease Specialist**: Since recurring fevers and swollen glands can sometimes be linked to infections, an infectious disease expert can investigate and manage infections that may be hard to diagnose.

Each of these providers plays a unique role depending on how your symptoms present and evolve.
