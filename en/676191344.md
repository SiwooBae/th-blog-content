## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Arlington, TX

When experiencing persistent thirst and frequent urination, there are a few types of healthcare professionals who can help identify what’s causing these symptoms and start treatment if needed. Based on your symptoms, you could consider seeing:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who treats a wide range of health issues and is a great first step. They can perform tests to check for common causes like diabetes or infections.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Similar to family doctors but typically focused on adult patients. They manage chronic illnesses and can coordinate more specialized care if needed.
- **Endocrinologist:** A specialist who focuses on hormone-related conditions, including diabetes. If your doctor suspects an endocrine problem, they might refer you here for detailed testing and management.

Starting with a family practice or internal medicine doctor usually makes sense, as they can perform initial evaluations and decide if you need to see a specialist like an endocrinologist.
