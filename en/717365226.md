## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Los Angeles

Based on your symptoms, several healthcare providers could be good starting points to get evaluated and supported:

- **Psychiatry**: Psychiatrists specialize in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect mood, behavior, and thinking. They can offer medical evaluations and prescribe medications if needed.
- **Neurology**: Neurologists focus on disorders of the nervous system, including the brain. They can help if your focus trouble might be related to neurological issues.
- **Clinical Psychologist**: Psychologists provide psychological testing and therapy to help identify cognitive or emotional causes behind attention problems.
- **Family Practice Doctor**: A family practice physician is a generalist who can evaluate your symptoms, rule out other medical causes, and refer you if you need specialized care.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor**: Similar to family practice doctors but typically focusing on adult patients, internal medicine providers can assess your overall health and cognitive concerns.
