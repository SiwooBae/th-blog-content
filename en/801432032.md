## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Miami

Given your combination of frequent headaches, dizziness, unusual heartbeats, and fatigue, a few types of healthcare providers can be a helpful place to start:

- **Family Practice Doctor**: A healthcare provider who handles a wide range of general health issues. They can diagnose and treat many conditions, order initial tests, and refer you to specialists if needed. A great first stop for your symptoms.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor**: Specialists in adult care who focus on internal organs and chronic conditions. They can provide a thorough evaluation and manage complex symptoms.
- **Neurologist**: A doctor focused on conditions involving the nervous system, including the brain. Seeing a neurologist can be important if your headaches are severe or unexplained.
- **Cardiologist**: A doctor specializing in heart and blood vessel conditions. Given your symptoms of a harder heartbeat and dizziness, they can check for heart-related causes.
- **Emergency Medicine Provider**: Suitable if your symptoms suddenly worsen, are severe, or accompanied by alarming signs like chest pain or severe weakness. Walk-in clinics typically do not provide emergency care but knowing this option is valuable.
