## Your Recommended Next Steps

Your health and peace of mind are important. Here’s how you can move forward confidently:

1. **Schedule an Appointment:** Contact a Family Practice or Internal Medicine provider first, as they can assess your overall symptoms and guide any further specialist referrals if needed. If your throat symptoms or swollen glands are prominent, an Otolaryngologist (ENT) is also a good choice.
2. **Prepare for Your Visit:** Write down all your symptoms—including fatigue, sore throat duration, swollen glands, and tongue changes. Note how long you've had them and any other concerns or questions.
3. **Discuss Costs Upfront:** When booking, ask about the costs of office visits and any recommended tests. The figures above are estimates for self-pay; your insurance coverage or provider selection may affect your final costs.
4. **Stay Reassured:** Remember, many causes of sore throat and tiredness are treatable once properly diagnosed. Seeing a healthcare professional is the best way to find answers and start feeling better.
