- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specialists focused on adult medicine who handle complex or chronic illnesses, and can coordinate further testing or specialist referrals.
- **Infectious Disease Specialist:** Doctors who focus on illnesses caused by infections, which could be relevant if your symptoms are related to an ongoing infection.
