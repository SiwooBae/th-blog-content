## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Anaheim

Given your symptoms—shortness of breath, tiredness, chest tightness, and swollen legs—a few types of healthcare providers could be a solid starting point for evaluation:

- **Internal Medicine Doctors:** These specialists focus on adult health and often treat complex medical conditions—including heart and lung issues—that could cause breathing problems and fatigue.
- **Family Practice Doctors:** General practitioners who provide broad care for the whole family. They can evaluate your symptoms, run initial tests, and refer you to specialists if needed.
- **Cardiologists:** Heart specialists who diagnose and treat heart-related problems. Since your symptoms suggest the heart might be involved, a cardiologist’s evaluation might be necessary.
- **Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiologists:** These are cardiologists with extra training in severe heart conditions. You may see them if initial tests suggest advanced heart issues.

Each type of provider can play an important role depending on your symptoms and diagnosis needs.
