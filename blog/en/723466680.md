# Feeling a Lump and Experiencing Weight Loss? A Guide to Your Next Healthcare Steps in New York, NY

Noticing a lump under your skin along with unexplained weight loss and fatigue can understandably be worrying. It’s natural to feel concerned when your body is sending signals that something might not be quite right. You might be wondering if these symptoms are related or if they might indicate something serious like cancer. If you’ve been searching for guidance on what to do next, you’re in the right place.

This post is here to help you understand what types of healthcare providers you might see for these symptoms, what kinds of exams or tests they may perform, and an estimate of what those visits could cost if you are self-paying or want to be informed ahead of time. Taking the first step to see a medical professional is important, and knowing what to expect can ease some of the uncertainty.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in New York, NY

Given your symptoms—a lump and unexplained weight loss—there are several types of doctors who could be a good starting point:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can evaluate a wide range of symptoms, order basic tests, and guide you on next steps or referrals. They often serve as the first stop for new or unexplained health concerns.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** A specialist in adult health who can provide a thorough examination, manage complex symptoms, and coordinate diagnostic testing to help understand your condition.
- **Medical Oncologist:** A doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating cancers. If your lump or weight loss raises suspicion of cancer, they may be involved in further evaluations and treatment.
- **Hematology-Oncologist:** A specialist who focuses on blood diseases and cancers. This type of doctor may assess symptoms related to blood disorders or cancers affecting the bone marrow or immune system.

Starting with a Family Practice or Internal Medicine doctor can often be the best approach to receive an initial evaluation and guidance. If necessary, they will refer you to oncology specialists for more focused care.
