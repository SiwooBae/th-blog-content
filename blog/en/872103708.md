## Who to See for Your Symptoms in New York, NY

Based on your symptoms—yellowing skin, fatigue, swelling, and itching—a few types of doctors could be a great starting point to get the evaluation and care you need:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions. They often provide initial evaluations and can coordinate further specialized testing or referrals, making them an excellent first stop.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Specialists in adult health who focus on complex or chronic conditions. They are well-equipped to evaluate symptoms like yours and guide you through necessary tests.
- **Gastroenterologist:** A doctor who focuses on the digestive system, including the liver and gallbladder. Given the yellow skin (which may indicate liver issues), they are important specialists to consider.
- **Hematologist:** A specialist in blood and related disorders. Some blood tests related to liver function and overall health may be managed or interpreted by hematologists, especially if blood abnormalities are suspected.
