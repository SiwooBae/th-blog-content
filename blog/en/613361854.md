## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Houston

Based on your symptoms of increased forgetfulness, several types of healthcare providers could be a great starting point to evaluate what’s happening and plan appropriate care:

- **Family Practice Doctors:** These are generalist doctors who handle a wide range of medical conditions. They can perform initial assessments, provide basic cognitive testing, and refer you to specialists if needed.

- **Internal Medicine Physicians:** Specialists in adult medicine, they can evaluate your overall health and rule out medical causes affecting memory, such as infections, vitamin deficiencies, or other conditions.

- **Geriatric Medicine Specialists:** These doctors focus on healthcare for older adults. If age-related cognitive changes are a concern, they can offer tailored assessments and care plans.

- **Neurologists:** Specialists in the nervous system, including the brain, neurologists can perform detailed evaluations to diagnose neurological causes of memory problems.

Seeing the right provider can help clarify whether your forgetfulness is a normal part of aging, stress, or if it requires further investigation and treatment.
