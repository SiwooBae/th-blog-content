These symptoms, including yellowing skin (jaundice) and abdominal bloating, can be signs of an underlying health issue that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. You’re not alone in searching for “yellow skin and bloated stomach” to start figuring things out, and you’re in the right place for guidance.

This post is here to help you understand what types of doctors you might see for these symptoms, what initial tests or visits may involve, and what costs you can expect in the Phoenix, AZ area. Our goal is to empower you with clear, calm information so you know how to take the next step with confidence.

## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Phoenix, AZ

Based on your symptoms of yellow skin and a bloated stomach, a few types of healthcare providers are good starting points for evaluation:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can diagnose and manage many common health concerns. They can order initial tests, provide treatments, and refer you to specialists if needed. A great first stop.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Focuses on adult medical care and manages more complex or chronic conditions. They can evaluate your symptoms thoroughly and coordinate any necessary tests or specialist consultations.
- **Gastroenterologist:** A specialist in digestive system disorders. Since you have a bloated stomach and yellowing, which could relate to liver or digestion issues, they can offer expert evaluation and treatment.
