## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Chicago, IL

Given your symptoms—a rash localized on the face combined with joint pain and fatigue—a few types of doctors stand out as excellent places to start:

- **Dermatology:** A dermatologist specializes in skin conditions. Since you have a distinct rash, they can evaluate the skin changes, potentially perform a biopsy if needed, and help diagnose skin-related causes of your symptoms.

- **Rheumatology:** Rheumatologists focus on joints, autoimmune diseases, and related conditions. Because joint pain and a rash together can sometimes indicate autoimmune issues like lupus, seeing a rheumatologist can help get to the root of your symptoms.

- **Internal Medicine:** Internists are experts in adult medicine and can evaluate complex symptoms that involve multiple body systems, including fatigue, rashes, and joint pain. They often coordinate the initial diagnostic testing.

- **Family Practice:** Family practice doctors provide comprehensive care for a wide range of issues. They can do a thorough assessment, order tests, and refer you to specialists if needed. They are a strong first step if you want one central provider managing your care.
