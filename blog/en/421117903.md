- **Family Practice Doctors:** General practitioners who can evaluate your symptoms, perform initial tests, and refer you if needed. They are a good first stop if you don’t already see a specialist.
- **Allergy and Immunology Specialists:** Since allergies and immune system problems can sometimes cause breathing difficulties, these doctors test for and manage allergies and immune-related conditions.

- **Internal Medicine Doctors:** These providers specialize in adult health and treat a wide range of conditions, including lung and heart health.
