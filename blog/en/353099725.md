## Who to See for Your Symptoms in The Woodlands, TX

Based on your symptoms—sore throat, fatigue, fever, and weight loss—there are several healthcare provider types that could be great places to start:

- **Family Practice:** A family practice doctor is a generalist who can diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions. They’re often the first point of contact and can help with common infections, ordering initial tests, and making referrals if needed.

- **Internal Medicine:** Internists specialize in adult medicine and can manage complex symptoms or chronic conditions. They often perform detailed evaluations and can coordinate more specialized testing.

- **Infectious Disease:** If your symptoms suggest a persistent or unusual infection, an infectious disease specialist has advanced expertise in diagnosing and treating infections that don't resolve easily.

- **Hematology-Oncology:** If weight loss or certain blood abnormalities are a concern, hematology-oncology doctors focus on blood diseases and cancers. They can conduct thorough evaluations to rule out serious blood disorders or cancers.

Each of these providers can offer valuable insight and may refer you for further tests or specialist care depending on what they find.
