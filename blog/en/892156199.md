## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Chicago, IL

With symptoms like constant shortness of breath, chest tightness, and a lingering cough, there are several types of healthcare providers who could help diagnose and treat what’s going on. Here are some options based on your symptoms:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist who can evaluate your breathing issues, run initial tests, and refer you to specialists if needed. They’re a great first step.
- **Pulmonary Disease Specialist (Pulmonologist):** These doctors specialize in lung health and breathing problems. They perform tests to measure lung function and treat conditions like asthma or COPD.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Similar to family practice but focused on adults and managing complex medical conditions, including respiratory issues.
- **Cardiologist:** Since the heart and lungs work closely together, a cardiologist can check if your heart is contributing to your breathing difficulty.
- **Emergency Medicine Provider:** If symptoms become severe or sudden, emergency care is important to rule out urgent causes.
