## Who to See for Your Symptoms in Miami

Given your symptoms — unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, and a hard lump — several types of healthcare providers in Miami may help discover the underlying cause:

- **Family Practice Doctor:** A generalist trained to diagnose and treat many health conditions. They are often the first stop for symptom evaluation and can perform basic tests or refer you to specialists.
- **Internal Medicine Doctor:** Focuses on adult medicine and can provide a comprehensive evaluation of complex or persistent symptoms, ordering blood tests and other diagnostics.
- **Medical Oncologist:** A specialist in cancers who may be involved if the lump or symptoms could relate to malignancy. They can perform biopsies and guide cancer-related diagnosis and treatment.
- **Hematology-Oncologist:** Combines expertise in blood-related cancers and disorders, helpful if symptoms suggest issues involving bone marrow or blood cells.

Starting with a Family Practice or Internal Medicine doctor is usually a practical first step. They can assess your symptoms, order initial tests, and guide whether you need to see an oncologist or hematology specialist.
